# Gym App

This is a simple app that can store and retreive information about Trainees, Trainers and Training plans using Spring Boot.

## Running

It requires java 17 and mvn 3.9.9+ to be able to run the app

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Usage

Right now it has no endpoint to access the api outside of the app itself.
